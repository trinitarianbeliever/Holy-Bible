<h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>
<ol>

<li>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</li>

<li>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</li>

<li>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</li>

<li>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</li>

<li>I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</li>

<li>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</li>

<li>The same was in the beginning with God.</li>

<li>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</li>

<li>And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</li>

<li>Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</li>
<li>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</li>

<li>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</li>
<li>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</li>
<li>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</li>
<li>And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</li>

<li>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</li>

<li>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</li>

<li>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</li>

<li>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</li>

<li>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</li>
