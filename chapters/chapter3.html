<h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
<ol>

<li>And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</li>
<li>Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</li>
<li>No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</li>
<li>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</li>
<li>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.</li>
<li>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</li>
<li>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</li>
<li>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</li>
<li>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</li>
<li>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</li>

<li>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.
He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</li>
<li>And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</li>
<li>And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.</li>

<li>Ye are the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.</li>
<li>And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</li>
<li>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</li>
<li>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</li>
<li>And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.</li>
<li>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</li>
<li>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</li>
