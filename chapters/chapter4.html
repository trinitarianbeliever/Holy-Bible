<h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
<ol>
<li>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</li>
<li>And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</li>
<li>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</li>
<li>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</li>
<li>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</li>
<li>I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</li>
<li>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</li>
<li>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</li>
<li>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</li>
<li>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</li>

<li>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.</li>
<li>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</li>
<li>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</li>
<li>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</li>
<li>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</li>
<li>But God raised him from the dead:
And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</li>
<li>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</li>
<li>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</li>
<li>The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;</li>
<li>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;
And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</li>
