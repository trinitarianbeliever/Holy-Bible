<h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
<ol>

<li>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</li>

<li>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</li>

<li>Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</li>

<li>I and my Father are one.</li>

<li>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</li>

<li>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</li>
<li>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</li>
<li>He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</li>
<li>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</li>
<li>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</li>
<li>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</li>
<li>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
But he spake of the temple of his body.</li>
<li>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</li>
<li>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</li>
<li>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</li>
<li>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:</li>
<li>For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</li>
<li>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</li>
<li>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</li>
